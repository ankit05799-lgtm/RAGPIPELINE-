 Title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline for Enhanced Information Retrieval

Description:
The RAG pipeline is a cutting-edge system that combines document retrieval with generative AI to provide accurate, context-aware answers from large collections of documents. Unlike standard generative models that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, the RAG pipeline retrieves relevant document chunks in real-time and uses them to guide the generation process, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving answer relevance.

Key Features:

Document Chunking:

Large documents are broken into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks for efficient retrieval.

Supports overlapping chunks to preserve context.

Embeddings & Vector Search:

Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings using state-of-the-art models (e.g., BERT, Sentence Transformers).

FAISS or ChromaDB is used for high-performance vector similarity search.

Real-Time Query Handling:

User queries are embedded and compared against the document embeddings to find the most relevant chunks.

The retrieved information acts as a knowledge base for the generative model.

Generative Answer Synthesis:

The pipeline uses a generative AI model (e.g., GPT/GROQ API) to produce natural language answers based on retrieved documents.

Minimizes hallucinations by grounding answers in the retrieved content.

Scalability & Optimization:

Multi-indexing support for handling large datasets.

Supports late chunking for memory efficiency and faster retrieval.

Real-time retrieval ensures low-latency responses.

Applications:

Question-Answering Systems

Document Summarization

Knowledge Management for Enterprises

AI Customer Support

Technologies Used:

Python, FAISS / ChromaDB, Sentence Transformers, PyTorch

REST API integration for real-time queries

Generative AI via GROQ/OpenAI API

Outcome:
The RAG pipeline allows AI systems to provide factually accurate, context-rich, and real-time responses from large document sets. This project demonstrates advanced techniques in retrieval-augmented generation, embeddings, vector search, and AI-powered natural language processing.
